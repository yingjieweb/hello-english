# Hello English üê£

English is important, as we all know, especially for software development. But it is not easy to learn. Learning and using English is a long-term process, it needs more insistence and patience.

I have been learning English for a long time. I have patience, but only in reciting some grammar rules and vocabulary. So my English ability is not good, It makes me feel a little sad. However sad feeling does not have the advantage of helping me improve my English ability.

Hence, I decided to create this project to record some knowledge about English. And I will work hard to improve my English ability. I believe I will make some progress in the future.

If you are interested in this project, welcome to join me. If it can help you, might as well <a href="https://github.com/yingjieweb/hello-english" target="_black">give me a star ‚≠êÔ∏è</a>
