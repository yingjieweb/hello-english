# Some General Rules

• Address your letters **to a specific person** if you can.

• Tailor your letters to specific situations or organizations by doing research before writing your letters.

• Keep letters concise and factual, **no more than a single page**. Avoid flowery language.

• Give examples that support your skills and qualifications.

• Put yourself in the reader's shoes. What can you write that will convince the reader that you are ready and able to do the job?

• **Don't overuse the pronoun "I"**.

• Remember that this is a marketing tool. **Use lots of action words**.

• Have an OCS adviser provide feedback, when possible.

• If converting to a PDF, check that your formatting translated correctly.

• Reference skills or experiences from the job description and draw connections to your credentials.

• Make sure your resume and cover letter are prepared with the **same font type and size**.
