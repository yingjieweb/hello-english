# SVO(主谓宾)

Subject-Verb-Object Structure (SVO)

The Subject-Verb-Object structure (SVO) is a fundamental sentence pattern that involves a subject acting on an object through a specified verb.

### 🎈 Structure

- Subject + Verb + [Object]

  > I help you.
  >
  > He crys.

- Subject(includes verb) + Verb + Object(includes verb)
  > Helping others is helping you.
  >
  > To help others is to help you.

### 🚩 Summary

When either the Subject or the Object includes a verb, the verb needs to be transformed into the form (to do) or (doing).

> 若主语或宾语包含动词，动词需要转换为(to do)或(doing)的形式。

If the action has already occurred, the verb should be in the form (doing); if not, it should be in the form (to do).

> 若事情已经发生，动词需要转换为(doing)的形式；若尚未发生，则转换为(to do)的形式。
