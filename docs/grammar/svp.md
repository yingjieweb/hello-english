Subject-Verb-Predicative Structure (SVP)

The Subject-Verb-Predicative structure (SVP) is a fundamental sentence structure that consists of a subject, a verb, and a predicative.

### 🎈 Structure

- Subject + (是) + Noun

  > I am a student. 「我是一个学生」

- Subject + (很) + Adjective

  > You are beautiful. 「你很漂亮」

- Subject + (在) + Locality
  > I am home. 「我在家里」

### 🚩 Summary

When the subject is in the first person, use "am"; for the second person, use "are"; and for the third person singular, use "is." When the subject is in the third person plural, use "are."

> 主语是第一人称用 "am", 第二人称用 "are", 第三人称单数用 "is". 主语是第三人复数称用 "are

You use "are" and I use "am", and "is" for the "he" "she" or "it". The number of subjects is "one" use "is", "two and more" use "are".

> 我用 “am” 你用 “are”，“is” 留给 “他”、“她”、“它”。 主语单数用 “is”，主语复数就用 “are”。
