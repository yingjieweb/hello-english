# Subject/Object/Predicative-Clause (主宾表从句)

Subject, Object, and Predicative Clauses are three distinct types of subordinate clauses, each serving unique grammatical functions within a sentence.

### 🎈 Structure

- **Subject-Clause:** Clause (Subject) + Verb + Object/Predicative

  > *That everyone speaks English* is usual.

- **Object-Clause:** Subject + Verb + Clause (Object)

  > I realize *(that) he is so smart*.

- **Predicative-Clause:** Subject + Verb + Clause (Predicative)

  > My hope is *that they are right*.

### 🚩 Summary

- The presence of a Subject/Object/Predicative-Clause in a sentence renders it complex. These clauses typically require the use of conjunctions like "that," "whether," or "if" to connect them.

> 如果句子含有主宾表从句，那么该句为复杂句。这些从句通常需要使用 "that"、"whether" 或 "if" 等连词引导。

- In the case of an object clause, the conjunction "that" is often optional and can be omitted.

> 如果从句是宾语从句，那么连接词 "that" 通常是可选的，可以省略。
